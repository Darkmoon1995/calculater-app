# Calculator App

A comprehensive calculator app built with C# and WPF, featuring a wide range of arithmetic and scientific functions. This project includes operations for basic calculations, advanced trigonometry, exponential functions, memory storage, and more.

## Features

### Basic Arithmetic
- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division** - Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- **Modulus (%)** - Supports modulus operation.
- **Plus/Minus Toggle (±)** - Toggle between positive and negative values.
- **Decimal Point (.)** - Allows for decimal input.

### Advanced Mathematical Functions
- **Trigonometric Functions** - Supports sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverse functions.
  - **Radians and Degrees** - Switch between radians and degrees for trigonometric functions.
- **Exponential Functions** - Calculate powers and exponential values:
  - `x^y`, `x^2`, `x^3`, `e^x`, `10^x`
- **Roots and Logarithmic Functions**:
  - Square root (√), cube root, nth root (y√x)
  - Logarithmic functions - natural log (ln) and log base 10.
- **Factorial Calculation** - Compute factorial for integers using `n!`.
- **Scientific Notation (E Notation)** - For handling exponential values in scientific format.

### Constants
- **Pi (π)** - Use the mathematical constant pi.
- **Euler's Number (e)** - Use Euler’s constant for exponential functions.

### Memory Operations
- **Memory Add, Memory Recall, Memory Subtract** - Store and recall values to memory.

### Other Features
- **Random Number Generation (RND)** - Generate a random decimal number.
- **Answer Button (Ans)** - Recall the last result for quick use.
- **Parentheses** - Support for parentheses to group expressions.

## Requirements
- .NET Core 3.1 or higher
- Visual Studio or any compatible IDE for building and running C# WPF applications.
